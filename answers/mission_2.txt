Debugging a failed transaction is a step-wise process
- Ask the User for other details about the transaction such as estimated date and time, payment method, and the response he/she got on the app.
- Look at the ledger and verify if the claim is indeed true by the user. 
- If the ledger has a transaction that the client is talking about but the status of it is pending, then it can either be
    1. Source bank account has failed to initiate the transaction
        - ask the source bank account to either cancel the transaction and refund the money or retry the transaction. 
    2. Destination bank account has failed to deposit money to the beneficiary account
        - ask the destination bank to complete the transaction
- Check to see if a transaction with some of the matching params exists, it might be a case of the User accidentally typing in the wrong details of the source account.
- if the above transactional errors are ruled out we can look at the Tech side of the application 
    
    - check telemetry logs from the user's device to see which parameters were sent to the server
        - try to duplicate the issue on the staging server with the same parameters
    - check server logs and see if we can see the trace of the server trying to initiate a transactions
        - check error logs at the same time user tried to initiate the transaction.
    - If the server performed its functions, it could be a database-level error 
        - check to see if the DB server failed recently or was restored using a backup. 
        - check if DB is performing  ATOMIC transactions for banking queries
    - monitor the health logs of the server and see if any downtime matches the time of the transaction. 

- More minuscule checking involves
    - check to see if all the softwares and libraries are running the latest version. 
    - patch commonly known vulnerabilities
